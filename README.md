# Portfolio of Akaash Dev

This project was created with CRA (Create React App).

This is my website to introduce myself, here I put my skills, portfolio, and contact forms.

# Key Features

1. Hero: The hero section serves as an introduction to the website and features a brief bio about me and my skills. Visitors can also download my resume and view my contact information.

2. Projects: The projects section showcases some of my best projects. Visitors can view project details such as project description, screenshots, and technologies used. Each project also features a link to the project's GitHub repository or live URL links.

3. Contact Method: The contact section features a contact form where visitors can send me a message. The form collects the visitor's name, email, and message, and sends an email to my email address.

4. Responsive Design: The application is designed to be fully responsive and works well on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
